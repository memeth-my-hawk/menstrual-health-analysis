SYNTHETIC MENSTRUAL HEALTH DATASET (1512 rows, 15 columns)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Data story
This synthetic dataset represents responses from a community health survey focused on menstrual health and lifestyle. 
Participants provided demographic and lifestyle information, along with self-reported menstrual cycle characteristics 
and symptom severity. The dataset is designed for educational and analytics purposes only and does not represent any 
real individuals.

Important note
- This is a fully synthetic dataset created to look realistic for practice in data analysis and modeling.
- The health-related fields (e.g., PCOS_Diagnosis, Endometriosis_Diagnosis) are synthetic labels for modeling practice; 
  they are NOT medical diagnoses.
